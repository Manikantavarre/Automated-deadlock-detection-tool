# Automated-deadlock-detection-tool
This project implements an Automated Deadlock Detection Tool designed to identify deadlock situations in operating systems by continuously monitoring process execution and resource allocation. The tool uses deadlock detection algorithms such as the Wait-For Graph method to automatically detect circular wait conditions among processes.
